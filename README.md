# where.voi
**where.voi** is a small project built in ⚛️React with react-mapbox-gl. I've used [Entur's Developer API's](https://developer.entur.org/) for keeping track of all Voi scooters in Oslo. I've also used the custom React hook [use-supercluster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-supercluster) to gather all the scooters in clusters. The scooter svg's are created in Figma.
